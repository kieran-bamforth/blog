title:  A thousand dotfile commits!
---

Shortly after my career began, I had the fortunate luck of meeting Josh, the
senior developer on my team. Things were uneventful until I saw it, he pressed
_tab_ on his keyboard and pow! His terminal showed a list folders that he could
then cycle through. Immediately, I had to know what it was. "This?" said Josh,
nonchalantly as ever. "Oh, this is just ZSH." He knew he had just changed my
life forever.

I started making consicous effort to save the dotfiles since 2015, and here are
some things I learned:

## Stop worrying and learn to love fuzzy finders.
When I snap my fingers, you will forget all about your precious files. You will
forget what they are called, where they are saved&hellip; all of it. Instead&mdash;
with your new found grey matter&mdash;whenever you&rsquo;d like to:
- Edit a file.
- Change directory, or
- Replay _that_ shell command you typed over a week ago*

And&hellip; [SNAP](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf)!
** FZF does all this, plus a fuck-load more.

## Alternate alt-tab.

## Ask for help
