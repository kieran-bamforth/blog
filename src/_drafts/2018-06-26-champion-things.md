# Staff can deliver their passions by focusing on delivering real world results.

## Intro

An advantage of working at a place like the BBC is that we get to work with lots
of different people, from different backgrounds and with different passions.
This means we get to learn from and enjoy the fruit of each other's labours, but
it also means we inevitably disagree with each other.

Some areas we disagree with each other include:

- Product / business priorities,
- Concrete things such as shared build processes, and then
- Time sinks such as:
    - Subjective things such as "returning early from functions vs. one way in,
        one way out".
    - Tabs vs spaces. (By the way I retract my "no linters in the pipeline
        ever" stance)...

So with the various passions & priorities going off, how do you get _your_
passions heard and _your_ ideas delivered within Content Discovery? The topic of
today's talk is on championing your ideals, and leaving _your_ own tangible
mark on how things are done around here.

Disclaimer! It's based on my own experience & observations, so I've tried to
balance with:

- Concrete things I've witnessed,
- Discussions I've had with other team members, plus
- A healthy slice of idealism from articles I've curated over the past couple
    years.

## Enroll people into your way of thinking

### Make your rationale clear, and progress visible.

It's not uncommon for people to ask you "I have a glimmer of an idea, will you
help me?" - think of all the time's somebody has asked you to build an app!

The problem with this is it's too challenging - it's too open ended. If you
were to help somebody else's "glimmer of an app idea", you'd have to sign up to
an unlimited obligation to something unimportant to you and a possible waste of
your time.

Consider the alternative - if somebody asks for your help who demonstrates an
understanding of:

- The problem,
- How their app is the solution,
- The target audience of their app,
- How much the app will cost,
- The potential struggles/bottlenecks the app will come against, and crucially
- They have a working prototype of the app,

They have just asked a much easier question. How much more likely are you to
help? Notice I didn't say anything how much money you'll get paid. Did pay
cross you mind?

**It's not enough to "bang a drum". Capture our imaginations with
something tangible**
