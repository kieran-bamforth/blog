title:  A thousand dotfile commits!
---

TLDR: I made 1000 commits to my private dotfiles today, and now I&rsquo;m
[open-sourcing](https://www.github.com/kieran-bamforth/dotfiles) them.

## The terminal and you :heart_eyes:.

God love the terminal, the Swiss-army knife in your developer toolbox&hellip;

Do you remember the first time you set eyes on it? The empty emptiness of no
GUI? The cursor blinking expectantly next to your name? The power to do
_anything_ should you remember a few, cryptic mnemonics? (I&rsquo;m looking at
you, [Bash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell))).

Fast forward&mdash;you&rsquo;ve been in the industry a year now. You can&rsquo;t
remember what the fuck IDE you used/raved on about in university (was it
[Coda](https://panic.com/coda/)? [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)?)
Regardless, big guns [Jetbrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/) has come out, and
there&rsquo;s an absolute _plethora_ of buttons for you to click and point
at (right after the splash screen has passed).

I started making consicous effort to save the dotfiles since 2015, and here are
some things I learned:

## Automate your system setup.

When starting a new job, I've known it to be the case where it takes
developers days to get their machines setup. Don&rsquo;t be that developer!

## Stop worrying and learn to love fuzzy finders.

When I snap my fingers, you will forget all about your precious files. You will
forget what they are called, where they are saved&hellip; all of it.
Instead&mdash; with your new found grey matter&mdash;whenever you&rsquo;d like
to:

- Edit a file.
- Change directory, or
- Replay _that_ shell command you typed over a week ago*

You can just type it sloppily into your shell. No need for precision here.  And&hellip; [SNAP](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf)!
