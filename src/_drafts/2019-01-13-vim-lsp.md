title: Autocomplete + Vim—in 2019.
---

A common observation can be made with newcomers to Vim; plethoras of plugins
transform the minimal editor into something vaguely resembling an IDE. Often,
it's not long until "autocompletion" comes up, and how Vim's apparent _lack_
thereof spawns posts titled "I can't get YouCompleteMe to work"...

If that sounds uncanny, I speak from a similar experience—like others before me,
I too tried YouCompleteMe, Eclim, Tern, Jedi... you may be unsurprised to know
**I uninstalled the lot**, committing instead to learn Vim's built-in
autocompletion. If you take one thing from this post, please let it be to study
`:help ins-completion`—`<C-x><C-l>` still provides what I need 9 times out of
10.

## But then came Language Servers.

Whilst developing _[VS Code][vscode-site]_, Microsoft introduced the [Language
Server Protocol][lsp-site] (LSP): an interface between **servers** and **text
editors** in which the servers provide text-editors with autocomplete
capabilities (et. al). These LSP-compliant servers—or Language Servers—are
different to traditional autocomplete engines in that they are vendor agnostic;
they run as stand-alone programs on a host machine instead of being bundled
within text-editors.

In practice this means you can install one Language Server, and have many
LSP-compliant text-editors use it. The inverse of this relationship means you
can install _one_ LSP plugin in your text-editor, and profit for as many
Language Servers you have installed:

![vim lsp][img-vim-lsp]

## Installing, configuring & using Language Servers.

Hopefully, this is starting to sound feasible to you—at least conceptually. In
my experience, the least documented/intuitive part of Language Servers is
**installing**, **configuring** and **using** them. Take for instance this
configuration advertised by the [autozimu/LanguageClient-neovim][lsp-plugin]
plugin:

```vim
let g:LanguageClient_serverCommands = {
    \ 'rust': ['~/.cargo/bin/rustup', 'run', 'stable', 'rls'],
    \ 'javascript': ['/usr/local/bin/javascript-typescript-stdio'],
    \ 'javascript.jsx': ['tcp://127.0.0.1:2089'],
    \ 'python': ['/usr/local/bin/pyls'],
    \ }
```

Without digging into the source code, this configuration suggests you can:
<ol type="A">
  <li>Boot up a Language Server by pointing to a binary on the host, or</li>
  <li>Connect to a Language Server that is already listening on a socket.</li>
</ol>
Let's explore the two options now.

### Option A: Boot up a Language Server.

This is probably the quickest way to get started—you can install a JavaScript
Language Server via  `$ npm install -g javascript-typescript-langserver`, and
then configure [LanguageClient-neovim][lsp-plugin] to use the global
`javascript-typescript-stdio` binary.  Boom, job done for JavaScript.

Want LSP for Python, too? Sure, `$ pip install python-language-server` and point
[LanguageClient-neovim][lsp-plugin] to the global `pyls`... Alright... now
imagine repeating this process for multiple languages; C#, Java, Go, Ruby,
Bash...  Okay... Now what if you have multiple machines—say a laptop for
personal use, and another one for work? Well, installing them all over again is
getting kinda _tedious_... **But shit**—the different laptops have installed the
Language Servers into subtly different locations, and now your [shared
dotfiles][dotfiles] are broken.

Option B then?

### Option B: Connect to a Language Server via TCP.

Alright this requires a little upfront effort, but with it I have **integrated
LSP into my everyday workflow**—something [I'm a stickler
for][1k-dotfile-commits]. The key difference is we shift responsibility for the
Language Server's life-cycle to the host machine, as opposed to the
[LanguageClient-neovim][lsp-plugin] plugin. Put another way, when we are able to
guarantee a Language Server is listening on a specific port, this provides a
contract needed to decouple Vim from machine-specific idiosyncrasies:

```vim
# Option A: Vim is coupled to location of Language Server
# binary, As the path can change, the config is brittle!

let g:LanguageClient_serverCommands = {
    \ 'javascript': ['/usr/local/bin/javascript-typescript-stdio']
    \ }

# Option B: So long as a Language Server is listening on
# port 2089 somehow, Vim doesn't care.

let g:LanguageClient_serverCommands = {
    \ 'javascript': ['tcp://127.0.0.1:2089']
    \ }
```

You can ensure the host is responsible for the Language Servers, by starting
them as system daemons. For instance—given both my personal and work laptops run
macOS—I (indirectly) create a launchd plist per language server, and install
them to into `~/Library/LaunchAgents`. These `*.plist` files can of course be
committed to (and installed by) your dotfiles-meaning you can easily
automate/repeat the installation across many machines.

## MacOS Bonus round: Install Language Servers via Homebrew

Alright, let's take everything we discussed and condense it into two of
