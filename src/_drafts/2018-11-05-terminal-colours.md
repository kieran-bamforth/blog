title: Level-up your terminal's colours.

Thanks to [/r/unixporn][unixporn], I'm _obsessed_ with good-looking terminals;
a casual browse foreshadows grokking the terminal's innards at some point
down-the-line. I'm surfacing today to help your terminal's colours **pop** off
the screenâ€”an **ode to your eyes** for consuming so much code everyday.

Alright enough hype. The first thing you're going to need is this `colour_bar`
function [from my dotfiles][colour-bar]:

```
awk 'BEGIN{
    s="/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\"; s=s s s s s s s s;
    for (colnum = 0; colnum<77; colnum++) {
        r = 255-(colnum*255/76);
        g = (colnum*510/76);
        b = (colnum*255/76);
        if (g>255) g = 510-g;
            printf "\033[48;2;%d;%d;%dm", r,g,b;
            printf "\033[38;2;%d;%d;%dm", 255-r,255-g,255-b;
            printf "%s\033[0m", substr(s,colnum+1,1);
        }
    printf "\n";
}'
```


-Make terminal look amazing
    -When I started out, I didn't realise how good terminals could look!
        -Start off with iTerm and oh-my-ZSH themes
            - Bold and thin text
        - Got into VIM, and started to find all-in-one themes
            - Themes that could work for iTerm, Vim and powerline.
                - solarized
                - Replaced powerline with Airline + tmuxline
    - Found gruvbox and noticed my colour scheme just did not match
        - italics were not working
        - colour was dimmer
            - set/help termguicolors
            - help xterm-true-color
            - help terminal-options
